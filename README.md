# Portfolio
Projects I have implemented so far:

- AP2022 is a project developed using HTML (bootstrap), CSS3 and some minor Javascript. It is a website for giving general information, advertising attractions and selling tickets to an anime convention, namely "Anime Po√ßos 2022". You can find the results online on < www.animepocos.com.br >.

- CV_PT consists of my own resume which I decided to implement using HTML5 and CSS3 mostly using the flexbox model.

- NLW is the result of an online course on the basics of HTML/CSS/Figma where I implemented a set Figma layout.
