# Portfolio

##Projects I have implemented so far:

- [AP2022](https://silasmarques08.github.io/portfolio/AP2022) is a project developed using HTML (bootstrap), CSS3 and some minor Javascript. It is a website for giving general information, advertising attractions and selling tickets to an anime convention, namely "Anime Po√ßos 2022". You can find the results online [here](www.animepocos.com.br).

- [CV_PT](https://silasmarques08.github.io/portfolio/CV_PT)consists of my own resume which I decided to implement using HTML5 and CSS3 mostly using the flexbox model.

- [NLW](https://silasmarques08.github.io/portfolio/NLW) is the result of an online course on the basics of HTML/CSS/Figma where I implemented a set Figma layout.
